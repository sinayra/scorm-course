Want to make SCORM easy? See our solutions at http://www.scorm.com.

This example demonstrates the use of basic runtime calls in a multi-page SCO. It
includes a demonstration of bookmarking, status reporting (completion and success), 
score and time. It also includes the addition of a basic "controller" for providing
intra-SCO navigation.
